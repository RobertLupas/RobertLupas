<h3 align="center"><img align="left" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-Coding-blue?style=flat" alt="I ❤️ Coding"/>Hi 👋, call me Robert<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_that_robert_/"><img align="right" src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=instagram"/></a>
</h3>

🚀 I'm a 15-year-old coder with a passion for web development, but not only. I love creating websites and web projects using different technologies like Node.js+Electron.js, but also plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚙️ I also like desktop development with C++ and other languages. Currently, I'm learning Java.

🎮 Aside from my enthusiasm for web and desktop development, I enjoy game development, creating my own games in Unity with mostly a pixel art style. When I'm not coding, I love indulging in my other hobbies, such as playing video games, modding Minecraft, and exploring photography and drones.

🪛 I'm always keen to learn something new and meet new people, so feel free to drop me a message or connect with me on social media.

💻 I'm working on a personal website but for now, I think <a href="https://scracx.carrd.co/">this one</a> is good enough 😉
