## Hi 👋, I'm Robert <img align="right" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-Coding-blue?style=flat" alt="I ❤️ Coding"/>

🚀 I'm a 16-year-old coder with a passion for programming. I love creating new projects and experimenting with new stuff.

### 🛠️ I’m currently working on:
- A better personal website 😆
- [Code for my FTC robotics team's robot](https://github.com/PrimeTech-Robotics/FTC-Into-The-Deep-RoadRunner) (this is an older, archived, public version, with not much in it)
- [RayTracing Lab](https://github.com/RobertLupas/RayTracing-Lab), a rendering engine made in C++. It's just a hobby project (for now), and not an actual "product"

Some of my projects are available here, [on GitHub](https://github.com/RobertLupas?tab=repositories). Check 'em out!
