🚀 I'm a 16-year-old developer who loves experimenting & building things from the ground up — from web apps to autonomous robots to embedded and IoT devices and more.

- 🔧 Currently a programmer @ [PrimeTech Robotics](https://github.com/PrimeTech-Robotics)

### 🛠️ I’m currently working on:
- A better personal website 😆
- [Code for my FTC robotics team's robot](https://github.com/PrimeTech-Robotics/FTC-Into-The-Deep-RoadRunner)
  > This is an older version, with not much in it. I'll publish the new code once the season is over
- [RayTracing Lab](https://github.com/RobertLupas/RayTracing-Lab), a rendering engine made in C++. It's just a hobby project (for now)
- and more, but these are the projects I like the most

Some of my work is available here, [on my GitHub](https://github.com/RobertLupas?tab=repositories). Check 'em out!

🛠 More cool stuff coming soon.
